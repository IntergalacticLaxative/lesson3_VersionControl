                <span class="text-muted">A smarter way to work</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that monitors and makes a snapshot of changes to a file or collection of files over a period of time so you can go back and retrieve older versions.  This allows you to have a copy of the file during each phase of production, which means that if you need to return to a previous version and start over, you can easily do so since you have every previous version to choose from.  Manually doing this on your local machine is time consuming and easy to mess up.  It involves creating a file naming system that makes sense as far as keeping track what was edited and when, and requires the user to stay on top of manually doing everything themselves.  This means it’s very easy to accidentally overwrite something, have multiple versions saved in different directories, or lose something entirely.  Version control is an attempt to streamline this process and make it much easier for the user, allowing them to dedicate more time to working on their task at hand rather than pulling their hair out trying to find which version to go back to and begin anew.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Version Control Systems:
                <span class="text-muted">Backing up your projects with ease</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems were developed to solve the problem of organizing previous versions of files.  They also offer a larger advantage over local backup methods in that they easily allow multiple users on the same project to make edits to the project and upload their versions and have them archived.  This means that no user’s code is permanently deleted due to someone else deciding it was unnecessary. There will just be two separate versions of the file, with two separate authors and dates.  This allows for easier collaboration on projects, where parts of one person’s work can be added to another’s in a streamlined and simple manner, and yet still retain the prior versions in case something goes awry.  With a distributed version control system such as Git, the users see a full mirror of the repository they set up.  This allows them to be able to retrieve their files no matter what, even if their machines completely crash. This also allows for certain permissions to be given to various groups of people, allowing some files to be accessible to some, while others cannot view them.  This provides greater control on a project as well as security.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git:
                <span class="text-muted">A better VCS</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git began as an alternative to BitKeeper, A VCS that at the time the Linux project was being backed up to.  As BitKeeper changed, the community decided they needed a VCS that could meet their needs, which included the ability to handle large project files and work very fast.  The design needed to be simple, and needed to support non linear development with a unique parallel branching system.  Thus, Git was born in 2005.  The large difference with Git is the way that it thinks about data.  Rather than viewing information as a set of files and a list of the changes made over time, Git views information like a set of snapshots.  Anytime you save the state of your work with Git, it takes a snapshot.  If the file remains unchanged, Git does not store a repeat of a file, it will merely link to a prior version.  This creates a unique way of storing various edits to a file, and makes Git fast and easy to work with.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git Advantages:
                <span class="text-muted">Examples of what makes it great</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Besides the unique way of viewing data as snapshots, there are other features of Git that make it a valuable tool for someone working on a project.  A huge advantage is that most everything needed to run Git involves local files.  The history of the project is contained within your local disk, which not only speeds up the process significantly, you also can check previous versions if you are offline.  You can commit to Git and it will push everything through once a connection is established.  Git also uses check-summing to know if any file has been altered in any way.  If the file becomes corrupted in transit, Git will know.  For the most part, Git only adds data.  This means that it won’t overwrite or cause you to lose important data, making edits care-free with no fear of tragically overwriting something important or losing the most important file in your project.  These are some of the reasons that make Git so great to work with compared to other VCS programs.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Three Stages:
                <span class="text-muted">How it works</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In Git, your file can have three states that it resides in.  These states are: committed, modified, and staged.  When committed, data is in your local database.  Modified means it has been changed, but not committed, and staged shows that a modified file is ready to be committed during the next snapshot.  This creates three areas for a Git project: the working directory, the Git directory, and the staging area.  Within the Git directory, metadata and the object database for the project is stored.  This can be copied from computer to computer and is very important.  The working directory is essentially a checkout of a version of a project.  It’s basically pulling the compressed files from the Git directory and allowing them to be placed onto your disc to modify.  Finally, the staging area is a file that will contain the information about what will be committed next.  So the standard Git workflow is something as follows:  Modify the files in the working directory, stage them and add snapshots, and do a commit.  </p>
